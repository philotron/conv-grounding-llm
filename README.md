# Towards Harnessing Large Language Models for Enhanced Comprehension of Conversational Grounding

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and data for the study titled "Towards Harnessing Large Language Models for Enhanced Comprehension of Conversational Grounding" submitted to IWSDS 2024.

## Contents

1. **Notebook:** The Jupyter notebook (`conv-grounding-llm-prediction.ipynb`) details the experimental procedures, prompts, and configuration of the large language model.

2. **Datasets:** The dataset `annotated_dialogues.xlsx` was utilized in the experiment as it contains the input dialogues. The LLM predictions are provided as four additional datasets.

## How to Use

### Jupyter Notebook

- Open the Jupyter notebook using a compatible environment or platform.
- Follow the step-by-step instructions to reproduce the experiment.
